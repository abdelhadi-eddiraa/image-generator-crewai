# Project Title: Creative Image Generation Tool



## Description

This project is a creative image generation tool that leverages the power of CrewAI and FastAPI. Given an image URL as input, it utilizes CrewAI's image classification and text prompt generation capabilities to create a descriptive prompt. Then, employing FastAPI's web framework, it feeds this prompt to an AI image generation model, producing a new image that resembles the style and content of the original input image.

## Key Features

- **Image-Based AI Image Generation**: Seamlessly integrate CrewAI's image analysis and prompt generation with an AI image generation model for a user-centric approach.
- **FastAPI Integration**: Build a robust and scalable API using FastAPI for seamless deployment and interaction.
- **Customizable and Flexible**: Fine-tune the process by adjusting CrewAI agents and the AI image generation model to achieve your desired artistic effects.

## Installation

### Prerequisites:

- Python 3.x (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- pip (https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py)

### Clone the Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
Install Dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the API Server:
bash
Copy code
uvicorn main:app --reload  # For development mode (optional: --host 0.0.0.0 for public access)
Send a POST Request:
http
Copy code
POST http://localhost:8000/generate-image
Body:
json
Copy code
{
    "image_url": "https://www.example.com/your_image.jpg"
}
Replace https://www.example.com/your_image.jpg with the actual URL of the image you want to use as a reference.

Response:
The API will return a JSON response containing the generated image URL. You can then download and display this image.

Example
Input Image:


Generated Image:

CrewAI Integration
Obtain CrewAI API Key:
Create a CrewAI account at https://www.crewai.com/.
Generate an API key under "Settings" -> "API Keys."
Set Up CrewAI Agents (Replace with your actual code):
python
Copy code
from crewai import Agent
from langchain_groq import ChatGroq
from tools.prompt_generation import PromptGenerationAgent  # Assuming you have a custom tool
```

# ... (other imports)

```python
def create_crewai_agents(api_key):
    groq_llm = ChatGroq(api_key=api_key, model="your_model_name")

    image_classification_agent = Agent(
        # ... (your image classification agent definition)
    )

    prompt_generation_agent = PromptGenerationAgent(
        # ... (your prompt generation agent definition)
    )

    return image_classification_agent, prompt_generation_agent
Disclaimer
```
CrewAI services may have usage limits or costs associated with them. Refer to their pricing page for details: https://www.crew-ai.com/pricing

The specific CrewAI agents and their configurations will depend on your project's requirements and chosen image classification and prompt generation models.

Additional Notes
Consider error handling and validation for the input image URL.
Explore advanced techniques like style transfer or artistic variations within the AI image generation model.
Provide more granular control over the process through API parameters (e.g., desired level of similarity, artistic style preferences).
Offer documentation for any custom tools or functionalities in your project.
